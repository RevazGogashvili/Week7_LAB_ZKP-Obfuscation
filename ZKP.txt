The simulate_malicious_prover function models the "Ali Baba Cave" ZKP protocol.

We have a cheating prover (Alice) who attempts to convince a verifier (Bob) that she has a password when she does not.
The goal of the code is to demonstrate the concept of Soundness:
Showing that without the secret, the probability of consistently fooling the verifier is statistically low.

Initialization:
The function accepts a trials argument (defaulting to 20 rounds).
It initializes a success_count variable to zero to track how many times the prover successfully guesses the correct path.

The Simulation Loop:
The code iterates through a for loop, representing the number of times the test is repeated.
In every iteration (round), two random events occur:
Prover's Entry (path_entered): The code randomly selects either path 'A' or 'B'.
This represents Alice walking into the cave.
Verifier's Challenge (challenge): The code independently selects a random path ('A' or 'B').
This represents Bob calling out which side he wants Alice to exit from.

Verification Logic (The "Cheater" Constraint):
Because this simulates a malicious prover who does not know the password,
the logical constraint is that the prover cannot pass through the locked door connecting the two paths.
Therefore: if path_entered is equal to challenge, the prover succeeds by luck.
If path_entered is not equal to challenge, the prover fails (she is trapped in the wrong tunnel).

Result Aggregation:
If the condition is met, the success_count is incremented.
The script then calculates the final success percentage:

--- Simulating Malicious Prover (No Password) over 20 trials ---
Round 1: Entered B, Challenge A -> Fail (Caught!)
Round 2: Entered B, Challenge A -> Fail (Caught!)
Round 3: Entered B, Challenge A -> Fail (Caught!)
Round 4: Entered B, Challenge A -> Fail (Caught!)
Round 5: Entered B, Challenge B -> Success (Lucky Guess)
Round 6: Entered B, Challenge B -> Success (Lucky Guess)
Round 7: Entered A, Challenge B -> Fail (Caught!)
Round 8: Entered B, Challenge A -> Fail (Caught!)
Round 9: Entered A, Challenge B -> Fail (Caught!)
Round 10: Entered A, Challenge A -> Success (Lucky Guess)
Round 11: Entered B, Challenge B -> Success (Lucky Guess)
Round 12: Entered B, Challenge B -> Success (Lucky Guess)
Round 13: Entered A, Challenge A -> Success (Lucky Guess)
Round 14: Entered A, Challenge B -> Fail (Caught!)
Round 15: Entered B, Challenge A -> Fail (Caught!)
Round 16: Entered A, Challenge B -> Fail (Caught!)
Round 17: Entered A, Challenge A -> Success (Lucky Guess)
Round 18: Entered B, Challenge B -> Success (Lucky Guess)
Round 19: Entered A, Challenge A -> Success (Lucky Guess)
Round 20: Entered A, Challenge B -> Fail (Caught!)

Final Results:
Total Successful responses: 9/20
Success Probability: 45.0%

The output demonstrates that a cheater's success rate converges towards 50% over time.
Thus proving that knowledge of the password cannot be reliably faked.
